How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it was easy to figure out the bug. It saved me lot of time.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By reverting back to certain point when required without wasting lots of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros:
Avoids too many automatic commits

Cons:
If the user forgets to commit and file crashes for some reason work might be lost


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
coding invloves a change to affect multiple files for a logic to complete

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log - used to know the commit id of tha commits 
git diff - used to see the difference between two commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I could make the changes more confidently as I have the option to compare and revert back to the working code if required easily
