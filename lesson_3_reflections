1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there is a team of people working on a open source project

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
As it avoids the changes that I might have made to the local copy.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: used to copy an existing github repository into another github location
       Used when user wants to create a new copy of the existing repository and make custom changes in user's github account
       
Clones: Used to copy an existing repository to another location
        used when the user wants to create a copy of the existing repository

Branches: Used to create a seperate copy of the existing code and make specific changes without affecting the master code
          Used while experimenting a new functionality to the working code
