What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository a .git file is created in the folder. That file helps the git to recognise it as a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the location where files are added before the intial commit. Staging area acts a cache area and we can revert the files before commiting.
